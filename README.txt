Extender 1.5.1
By Anthony Kleine

This is a template to extend the code of any module. It is loosely based on PlatinumTeam's MB Extender, but is much more lightweight.

All the values which need to be set may be found in the extender function in main.cpp. All addresses passed to the test/extend functions must be Relative Virtual Addresses. This template will not help you write the extended code - that part you will need to do yourself.
