Extender 1.0
By Anthony Kleine

This is a library to extend the .text section of any module. It is loosely based on PlatinumTeam's MB Extender, but is much more lightweight.

All the values which need to be set may be found in main.h. This library will not help you write the extended code - that part you will need to do yourself.
